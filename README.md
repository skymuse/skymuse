I like programming, drawing, and making electronic music. For downtime I like to play xbox, read manga, and watch sports (basketball, hockey). Cool.

Anyways, the main purpose of this account is to share programs I've written, all in the hopes that someone out there finds them useful. The second purpose of this account is to learn how to participate in open source developement, since I feel as if I can give back with the skills I've sharpened over the years. 

I mainly program using nodejs/typescript professionally, and in my spare time I program using python, golang, and rust.
