I'll keep it simple. I like programming, drawing, music production, and writing, all as my hobbies. For downtime I like to play xbox, watch anime, and watch basketball. Cool.

Anyways, the main purpose of this account is to share useful programs I've written, all in the hopes that someone out there finds them useful. The second purpose of this account is to learn how to participate in open source developement, since I feel as if I can give back with all the skills I've sharpened over the years. 

I mainly program using nodejs as a career, and in my spare time I program using rust and python. Finally I like sharing information, so if you guys have any questions (or just want to discuss stuff), feel free to reach out using skymuse7@gmail.com.
